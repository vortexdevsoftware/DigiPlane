# Digiplane

## Introduction

Digiplane is a 2D OpenGL game engine that makes it easy to create high-quality 2D games. It provides simple high-level and low-level access to core features such as using HLSL/GLSL shaders, creating and managing scenes, and uses a entity-component system. Digiplane also supports Linux and Windows.

If you would like to try out the framework, check out the [tutorial](https://digiplane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).

## Features

- HLSL/GLSL shader support - Create your own shaders and easily use them in Digiplane.
- Entity-component system ([flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs)) - Create your game objects in a component-based way.
- Scene management - Make your game logic modular by creating scenes that contain your entities and components.
- Linux and Windows support - The framework is cross-platform, so you can easily build your games to both platforms.
